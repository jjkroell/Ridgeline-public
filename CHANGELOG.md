# Changelog

All notable changes to Ridgeline (the public, self-hostable build) are documented
here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and
this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [v0.5.2] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Deleting an observer now removes its device telemetry too.** The
  battery/noise series is keyed by observer id and nothing else references it,
  so deleting the observer stranded every sample it had ever recorded — rows no
  page could reach and no sweep collected, for every observer ever deleted. The
  delete dialog said "all of its stored packets"; it now says what it does, and
  reports the telemetry rows removed.

### Known issue
- Observer identity is the friendly name, so **renaming an observer strands its
  telemetry** under the old name and starts a fresh series. This is separate
  from the fix above and is not addressed here — a rename is not a deletion, and
  the stranded samples are real measurements worth keeping until observers are
  keyed by something stable.

## [v0.5.1] — 2026-07-19

Decommissioned observers no longer come back from the dead.

### Fixed
- **A retired observer stays retired.** Observers publish their `/status` with
  the MQTT retain flag, so the broker keeps that message and replays it to the
  daemon on *every* reconnect — for as long as it exists, whether or not the
  device is still on the air. The daemon treated a replay as a live sighting and
  re-created the observer, which is why one removed from the observers page
  reappeared after the next restart or redeploy. A retained status is a stale
  last-known value: it may now refresh an observer that already exists, but it
  can never create one.
- **No more invented telemetry.** The same replay appended a battery/noise
  sample stamped with the reconnect time — a reading that was never taken, one
  per reconnect, for as long as the retained message lived.
- **The observer count on the dashboard** now agrees with the observers page.

### Added
- **Retire an observer** instead of deleting it. Retiring withdraws a
  decommissioned receiver from the observers page and keeps every packet it
  reported, still attributed to it in history. Deleting an observer removes its
  packets too, which quietly rewrites the record — retiring is the right action
  for a receiver that has simply left the network. Reversible from the admin
  console, on desktop and mobile.

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-07-19

RF bridge detection, rebuilt. The previous detector could not find a live bridge
on the mesh it was written for; this release finds it, explains why it was
missed, and keeps a bridge you run on purpose from being reported as news
forever. Design notes and the evidence behind it are in
[docs/bridge-detection.md](docs/bridge-detection.md).

### Added
- **A second detection signal: wired egress.** RF is broadcast, so which
  neighbour relays a packet next varies — a typical relay hands off to ~13
  different nodes. A relay whose next hop *never* varies is handing off over a
  cable. This finds a bridge however few nodes sit behind it; the old rule needed
  three and could not see a small far side at all. Both rules now run and every
  candidate is labelled with the signal(s) that produced it.
- **Moved behind a bridge.** Nodes that stopped being heard directly and now
  arrive through a bridge are reported in their own right. A node keeps its
  public key across a frequency change, so nothing else notices it moved.
- **Known bridges.** Mark a bridge you run on purpose: it moves to its own list
  and stops appearing as a candidate. Nothing is blocked or hidden — the
  opposite of Dismiss, which says a candidate is not a bridge.
- **Scan summary and per-candidate evidence** in the admin console: packets
  scanned, paths, unresolved hops, adverts rejected, and for each candidate the
  traffic it carried, how many distinct next hops it had, and whether an observer
  ever received its own transmission.

### Fixed
- **Path evidence now comes from every packet type, not just adverts.** A route
  is in the clear whatever the payload; only the *origin* needs an advert. A
  companion that never adverts previously contributed nothing at all despite its
  messages crossing a bridge with a full path attached — on the reference mesh
  this raised the evidence base from 1,699 adverts to 5,667 packets per window.
- **Side membership is judged on recent evidence.** A single direct reception
  anywhere in the window used to mark a node local for the whole window, so a
  node that moved kept being excused by evidence that had expired hours earlier.
- **Adverts whose signature does not verify are rejected.** A corrupt public key
  invents a node that never existed; those phantoms were surfacing as injector
  candidates.
- **Ordinary repeaters no longer flagged as bridges.** A single unvarying next
  hop is also what a repeater with exactly one reachable neighbour looks like;
  a candidate must now actually carry a far side.
- **Admin console** only renders sections that hold something, and the Known
  action is no longer adjacent to the show/hide toggle.

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Claimed filter on the Nodes list**, showing your own nodes first and other
  operators' after. It joins the role and favorites filters in a new filter
  modal, replacing the row of pills that competed with the table: the header is
  now a search field and one control that names the active filters
  ("Repeaters · Claimed") so the constraint is legible at a glance.
- **Member management on mobile.** `/m/admin` gained the MEMBERS panel — promote
  or demote admins, block, unblock and remove — matching the desktop console.
  Both now share one component.
- **Dormant claims and shares.** A claim or location share outlives its node when
  the retention sweep prunes a node that has gone quiet. Those rows now render
  un-linked with a "Dormant" pill explaining the claim is kept and reconnects if
  the node advertises again, instead of linking to a "Node not found" page.

### Fixed
- **Scrubbing a node now removes the data attached to it** — the ownership claim,
  notes, private location and location shares. Previously they were orphaned: the
  claim still showed in "Claimed Nodes" pointing at a node that no longer existed,
  and it would have blocked the node from ever being re-claimed. Re-scrubbing a
  key cleans up leftovers from earlier scrubs.
- **The automatic retention sweep no longer deletes that data.** A node pruned for
  going silent is expected to come back, so an operator who takes a repeater down
  for a week keeps their claim and private location.
- **Heuristic sweeps skip claimed nodes.** Neither the corruption-artifact scrub nor
  the detector-driven bridge purge will delete a node someone has claimed — a claim
  means the heuristic misfired. Purge still blocks (reversible); only the delete
  holds back, and the console reports what it skipped.
- **The live feed backfills after a reconnect.** A dropped WebSocket (redeploy,
  tunnel blip, laptop sleep, backgrounded PWA) left a permanent hole: the page
  looked connected while silently omitting everything from the outage. Channel
  conversations would simply stop updating until reload.
- **Nodes lists sort by the time they display.** Ordering used the last advert
  while the "Heard" column showed the most recent advert *or* relay, so rows could
  appear out of order.
- **The mobile "Companions" filter matched nothing** — it filtered on a role value
  no node reports.

## [v0.3.2] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Password reset.** A "Forgot password?" flow: request a reset link by email
  (`POST /api/auth/forgot`, always responds 200 so it never reveals whether an
  address has an account), then set a new password from the emailed single-use
  link (`/reset-password`, 1-hour expiry). Completing a reset revokes the
  account's other sessions, confirms the email address, and signs you in.
  Available on desktop and mobile.

### Security
- **Login brute-force protection.** `POST /api/auth/login` is now rate-limited per
  client IP and per target account (429 when exceeded, returned before the account
  lookup so it reveals nothing). Bursts stay generous enough for a mistyped
  password but bound sustained guessing. The reset endpoint is IP-limited too.

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- `setup.sh` now asks whether the install is production or dev/staging. Choosing
  dev/staging writes `environment: "dev"` into `config.json`, enabling the "not
  the live site" banner without editing config by hand.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- Account deletion now opens a prominent confirmation modal that spells out
  exactly what is removed (account, notes, private locations, shares, sessions)
  versus what remains (nodes you own are released, not deleted — kept public and
  marked "previously owned by …"). The delete button activates only after you
  re-type the account's registered email (case-insensitive) in addition to the
  password.
- Config-gated non-production banner: set `environment` (e.g. `"dev"` or
  `"staging"`) in `config.json` and the UI shows a persistent, obvious "not the
  live site" banner (using your configured site name). It is reported via
  `/api/health`; unset (the default) shows nothing, so production instances are
  unaffected.

### Fixed
- The claimed-node ownership badge now recolours immediately when a claim
  verifies or a node is released, instead of only after a full page reload.
- Long values in confirmation dialogs no longer overflow the modal: dialog
  title/message wrap, and a public key (e.g. in the "scrub node" prompt) is
  shown centred in a dedicated one-line monospace slot sized to fit.

### Changed
- The daemon logs the effective email `baseURL` at startup and warns if it is
  empty while email is enabled, so a misconfigured link origin is obvious.
- Removed the hardcoded default email `baseURL`; each instance must set its own
  public origin in `config.json`. A hardcoded default could silently send an
  instance's verification links to the wrong origin.

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-07-17

Hardening follow-up to v0.2.0.

### Security
- Cap request bodies at 64 KB via a `MaxBytesReader` middleware on all routes
  (except the `/api/live` WebSocket). Endpoint length limits were previously
  enforced only after fully decoding the JSON body, so an unbounded POST could
  buffer arbitrary memory before any check ran; the cap keeps memory bounded and
  the handler returns its usual 400.

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-07-17

Security hardening plus a one-command updater. **Recommended update for anyone
running v0.1.0.**

### Security
- Rate-limit the unauthenticated email endpoints (`POST /api/auth/register`,
  `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`), keyed by client IP and target address, to
  prevent mass verification-email sends, SMTP-quota burn, inbox-bombing, and
  account enumeration.
- Strip CR/LF from outgoing email headers (`To`/`From`/`Subject`) to block email
  header injection.
- Enforce same-origin on the `/api/live` WebSocket (was allow-all) to block
  cross-site WebSocket hijacking.
- Remove the dead `adminToken` config field and its misleading "protects /admin"
  framing. Admin access is the **first registered account** (the protected owner);
  a leftover `adminToken` in an old `config.json` is now simply ignored.

### Added
- `update.sh` — one command to pull the latest, rebuild, restart, and wait for
  health. Preserves your config (`web/.env`, `deploy/config.json`, `deploy/.env`)
  and database, and auto-handles conflicts with installer-personalized files.
  `./update.sh --external` for external-broker installs.
- Documentation: a prominent note that the first registered account becomes the
  owner/admin, and an expanded "Updating" guide.

### Tests
- Added tests for the rate limiter, client-IP extraction, same-origin WebSocket
  check, and email header-injection safety.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-07-17

Initial public, self-hostable release.

### Added
- Interactive `setup.sh` installer: Q&A for site name, region/map center, MQTT
  broker (self-hosted or external), SMTP, opt-in About page, and domain/TLS.
- Build-time personalization (`web/.env`, `web/src/lib/site.ts`,
  `web/src/lib/site-content.ts`) — nothing is tied to any particular mesh, place,
  or server; no phone-home calls or analytics.
- GDPR/PIPEDA cookie-consent banner and `/privacy` page.
- Node detail: a range-selectable "Heard by" list (`/api/nodes/{pubkey}/observers`);
  removed the redundant "Recent packets" card.
- Docker stack: multi-stage build (Node → Go → distroless), container healthcheck,
  version stamping, and a `docker-compose.external.yml` variant for running
  alongside an existing broker with your own reverse proxy.
- Startup resilience: the daemon serves the API and web UI even if the MQTT broker
  is unreachable at startup, retrying the connection in the background.
- `docs/CONFIG.md` configuration reference.
